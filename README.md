Simple and easy-to-use browser solution for developers and designers. No more having to resize your window ðŸš€

Go try it now at https://everysize-app.kibalabs.com. It works across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge and any other Chromium-based browsers too.

## Features

#### ðŸ”’ Browser-based = built in security
No installation required. We use iframes on your browser so you don't have to enter your credentials on a downloaded application to test your secure pages.

This also means you can look out for browser quirks!

#### ðŸ˜Ž All the sizes you need
Test pages in all the sizes that matter to you - we have iOS, Android and bootstrap sizes pre-installed. Use the zoom feature to fit all the devices you need on a single page. You can always make your own whacky sizes too.

#### ðŸ–¥ Create a tailored dashboard
Once you configure your dashboard it will stay saved for you to check in whenever needed. It will even hot reload if your dev environment is set up for that!.
